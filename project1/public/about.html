         <p>African Lion (Panthera leo leo): The African lion, often simply referred to as the "lion," is the most recognized and widely distributed type. It inhabits savannas, grasslands, and open woodlands across sub-Saharan Africa. African lions are known for their social structure, with prides consisting of multiple related females, their cubs, and a coalition of males.</p>
        
    <p>Barbary Lion (Panthera leo leo): The Barbary lion, also known as the Atlas lion, was native to North Africa, particularly the Atlas Mountains of Morocco. Sadly, they are now extinct in the wild. Efforts are being made to reintroduce captive-bred lions with Barbary lineage to the wild, aiming to revive this unique subspecies.</p>
    
    <p>Transvaal Lion (Panthera leo krugeri): The Transvaal lion, found in the region of South Africa's Transvaal province (now Gauteng, Limpopo, and North West provinces), is often associated with the Kruger National Park. They are known for their striking manes and are a key attraction for wildlife enthusiasts visiting the area.</p>
    <p>The lion, scientifically known as Panthera leo, is often regarded as the king of the animal kingdom due to its majestic appearance and powerful nature. These magnificent creatures are native to the African continent and are known for their distinct golden-yellow coats and impressive manes, which vary in color and size between individual lions. Lions are highly social animals and live in groups called prides, typically consisting of several related females, their offspring, and a few dominant males. Their strong bonds within the pride help them cooperate during hunting and protect their territory.</p>
    
    <p>Lions are formidable predators, with a keen sense of sight and hearing, and they primarily feed on large mammals such as zebras, wildebeests, and buffalo. These carnivorous creatures are known for their powerful roars, which can be heard from miles away and serve as a means of communication within the pride. While their population has faced challenges due to habitat loss and poaching, efforts in conservation have been made to protect these iconic big cats and ensure their continued presence in the wild. Lions remain a symbol of strength and majesty, captivating the imagination of people around the world.</p>
